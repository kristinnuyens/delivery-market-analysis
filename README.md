# Delivery Market Analysis (TakeAway)

## Setup and Exploration
1.	Set up GitHub repository delivery-market-analysis, provide needed accesses, initialize it with a README file documenting the project goals, install necessary items
2.	Explore the database(s): copy TakeAway, UberEats, and Deliveroo database files and take a look at their schema to understand their data structure

## SQL Queries Development
3.	Study project deliverables:

- What is the price distribution of menu items?
- What is the distribution of restaurants per location?
- Which are the top 10 pizza restaurants by rating?
- Map locations offering kapsalons (or your favorite dish) and their average price
- Which restaurants have the best price-to-rating ratio?
- Where are the delivery ‘dead zones’—areas with minimal restaurant coverage?
- How does the availability of vegetarian and vegan dishes vary by area?
- Identify the World Hummus Order (WHO); top 3 hummus serving restaurants.
- Best restos in Leuven price/rating
- Restaurants with explicit low carb options

Day 2: SQL Queries Development (CONTINUED)
- Write SQL Queries:
  - Focus on creating and testing queries for the must-have questions:
    - For price distribution: SELECT, GROUP BY, and AVG functions.
    - For restaurant distribution: COUNT and GROUP BY.
    - Rating aggregation for top pizza restaurants: JOIN, ORDER BY, LIMIT.
    - Mapping locations for specific menus: spatial data queries if applicable.
- Test and Optimize Queries:
    - Ensure each query runs efficiently; use indexes if necessary. Optimize for readability and performance.
